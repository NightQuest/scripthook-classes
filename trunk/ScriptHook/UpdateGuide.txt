A general upgrade info guide to ScriptHook 0.2.5+ from earlier versions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

From 0.2.5 onwards, ScriptHook is distributed as a compiled dynamic dll instead
of a static lib. This requires some minor changes be made to your code for this to work.

1. Don't call ScriptHookManager::Initialize() -- This will be done for you automatically.

2. Don't call ScriptHookManager::Shutdown() -- This will be done for you automatically as well!

3. The only thing you have to do is register your threads using ScriptHookManager::Register()
   See SampleCustom\Main.cpp

4. Don't add loggers (both the ODS and File loggers are added automatically). You can however choose 
   to add your own custom loggers if you have any. The File logger will always log to ScriptHook.log 
   (not YourDllName.log). Note that custom loggers will capture log output from all ScriptHook clients.

5. The new version of Scripting.h has more natives documented. These natives may clash with your own 
   if you already have them defined with the same signature. You may choose to comment out yours (recommened) 
   or comment out the one in Scripting.h. Note that if you have the same native declared but the parameters
   are different, compilation should be fine (thanks to C++ overloading).

   Also note that there are currently many incomplete enums. When invoking methods that require these enums you
   can pass an integer value and cast it to the enum type, i.e: DamagePedBodyPart(ped, (ePedBodyPart)4, 50)

6. The Debug compilation configuration requires additional dlls that your users may not have.
   Remember to compile in Release mode when you build your final DLL to distribute.

7. You may choose to include the release ScriptHook.dll along with your mod. However, it is
   recommended that you instead link to the ScriptHook GTAForums topic so that your users will 
   always have the latest version of ScriptHook.dll.
